## 1. Problem Statement
Colleges and training institutes often manage student registration, course catalogues and enrollment through spreadsheets and messages, which is slow, error-prone and gives students no visibility of their progress. **ACADEXA** provides one secure, responsive platform to manage students, courses, enrollments and communication in real time.

## 2. Target Users & Requirements
| User | Needs |
|---|---|
| **Student** | Register/login securely, browse courses, enroll, track progress, get notified, chat with peers/admin, edit own profile |
| **Admin** | Add/edit/delete courses, view/delete students, see platform statistics, send announcements, chat with students |

## 3. Features
- ✅ Student registration & login with **JWT authentication** and **bcrypt** password hashing
- ✅ Role-based access control (student / admin) and protected routes (frontend + backend)
- ✅ Course catalogue with search, enrollment, progress tracking (Not Started → In Progress → Completed)
- ✅ Student dashboard (profile, stats, enrolled courses, recent notifications)
- ✅ Admin console: course CRUD, student management, statistics, announcements
- ✅ **Real-time notifications** (Socket.IO) – new course, enrollment confirmation, completion, admin announcements
- ✅ **Real-time one-to-one chat** with online/offline status and typing indicator
- ✅ Client-side validation with error/success messages, dynamic navigation (login/logout aware)
- ✅ Responsive UI (desktop / tablet / mobile), loading & error states
- ✅ Centralized error handling, input sanitization, CORS, request logging

## 4. Tech Stack

## 6. Setup & Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MongoDB – either **MongoDB Community Server** running locally, or a free **MongoDB Atlas** cluster

### Backend
```bash
cd Backend
npm install
# edit .env if needed (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET)
npm run seed        # creates admin, demo student and sample courses
npm run dev         # http://localhost:5000
```

### Frontend (new terminal)
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev         # http://localhost:5173
```

### Demo accounts (created by `npm run seed`)
| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@acadexa.com` | `admin12345` |
| Student | `student@acadexa.com` | `student123` |

### Environment variables
**Backend/.env**
```
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/acadexa
JWT_SECRET=<long random string>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```
**Frontend/.env**
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## 7. API Reference (base: `/api`)

Import `postman/ACADEXA.postman_collection.json` into Postman to test every endpoint.

**Socket.IO events:** `chat:send`, `chat:message`, `chat:typing`, `notification:new`, `presence:update` (connection authenticated with the JWT).

## 8. Database
MongoDB with 5 collections – `users`, `courses`, `enrollments`, `notifications`, `messages`. See [`docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`](docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) for the ER diagram.

## 9. Security
bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds) · JWT verification middleware · role-based authorization · input validation + NoSQL-injection sanitization · restricted CORS · secrets only in `.env` · centralized error handling (400/401/403/404/409/500) · password hash never returned by the API.

## 10. Deployment
1. **Database** – create a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas, add a DB user, allow network access (`0.0.0.0/0` for testing) and copy the `mongodb+srv://...` connection string.
2. **Backend (Render)** – New → Web Service → connect the GitHub repo.
   Root directory `Backend` · Build `npm install` · Start `npm start`.
   Environment: `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d`, `NODE_ENV=production`, `CLIENT_URL=<your frontend URL>`.
   After the first deploy, run the seed once from the Render shell: `npm run seed`.
3. **Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)** – Root directory `Frontend` · Build `npm run build` · Output `dist`.
   Environment: `VITE_API_URL=https://<backend>.onrender.com/api` and `VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://<backend>.onrender.com`.
4. Put the live URLs at the top of this README.

## 11. Testing Checklist
- Register → Login → JWT stored → protected routes work; no token → `401`
- Student cannot call admin endpoints → `403`
- Admin adds a course → students get a real-time notification
- Student enrolls, updates progress, completes a course
- Open two browser tabs (two users) → chat messages arrive instantly
- Resize the browser (desktop / tablet / mobile) → no horizontal scrolling
